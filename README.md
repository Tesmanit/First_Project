You have to create your own superuser through "python manage.py createsuperuser"
I provided some fixtures for easier testing
You also have to create your own .env file  with all needed settings.py preferences (DBNAME, DBUSER, DBPASS, EMAIL_USER, EMAIL_PASS)
You can install all required packages via "pip install -r requirements.txt"
